# Music Visualiser Project

# How it works
the Program runs when you hit f5, the waves will allready be there making waves from left to right as a standard when the program runs. 
hitting the space key will start the music and thats when the waves change diractions instead of left to right it goes back to front, the musicals amplitude. changes the direction of the wave and the hight of every wave accordingly. pressing the key 'b' will change the speed of the waves to increase making it seem like a faster/ wilder ocean. the key 'c' will change the colour of the tringle strips to change into a rainbow colored wave. the key'1' changes it from the waves to sun.
the class spawnsun was supposed to create several planets orbiting around the sun from oceanwave. how ever I was not able to get it working even thoe i know I'm very close. I kept getting a null pointer exeption error. this was my biggest problem as it was a big part of my original idea.
# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I'm most proud of making the sphere. which i\I call sun. Instead of using the function sphere(). I found out that if I wanted to interact with the "sun" I need to create the sphere myself so that I could acesses the different points of the sun. Doing this required math and the use of Pvektors. 
# Classes
-Illuminati was used to test code and play around with shapes without filling in colours to better understand behaviour. 
-firwork was experementing with the rotations shown from skeleton code. 
-spawnsun was going to implement sever suns spawning around the field of view.
-oceanwave is the main class to be run. this is where the code got implement after it was tested in the other classes.
